Using a layer, create a tileset that can be used to paint tiles on other layers.

**How to enable:**

1. **Right-click** the desired layer
2. Select **Extra > Create TileSet**

Layers marked as TileSet must be positioned at the top of the layer stack since they render independently to prevent overlap. 
Tiles should only be created in the first frame.

Toggle the far right button to activate the tileset. You can now paint onto any non-tileset layer. 
The paint, erase, shape, and paint bucket tools will display a green bar indicating they're in tileset mode.
